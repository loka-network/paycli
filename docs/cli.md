# CLI reference

`paycli` is a single binary covering the full agent-side payment flow:
account creation → invoice issuance → invoice settlement → L402-protected
HTTP requests. Two routes are supported, mutually exclusive per config:

* **`--route hosted`** (default) — talks to `agents-pay-service` via REST
  + `X-Api-Key`. The custodial / Loka-managed wallet.
* **`--route node`** — talks directly to a user-run `lnd` / `lnd-sui` REST
  gateway via TLS + macaroon. The self-custody wallet.

Once configured, every other command (`whoami`, `fund`, `pay`, `request`,
`history`) dispatches automatically based on the saved route — no flag
needed on each call.

## Install

```bash
make build           # → bin/paycli
make install         # → $GOBIN/paycli
```

## Global flags

| Flag | Env var | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `--base-url` | `PAYCLI_BASE_URL` | Override the agents-pay-service base URL |
| `--insecure` | `PAYCLI_INSECURE` | Skip TLS verification on the wallet endpoint |
| `--config`   | `PAYCLI_CONFIG`   | Override config file path (default `~/.paycli/config.json`) |

The config file is created on `register` and updated by `login`. It stores
`route` plus two route-specific sub-objects:

```json
{
  "route": "hosted",
  "insecure_tls": false,
  "hosted": {
    "base_url": "...",
    "admin_key": "...",
    "invoice_key": "...",
    "wallet_id": "...",
    "user_id": "...",
    "admin_bearer_token": "..."
  },
  "node": {
    "endpoint": "...",
    "tls_cert_path": "...",
    "macaroon_path": "..."
  }
}
```

Older paycli builds wrote a flat schema (`base_url`, `admin_key`,
`node_endpoint`, ... at the top level). Those configs are still loaded
correctly — paycli folds the legacy fields into the new `hosted` /
`node` sub-objects on read, and the next `register` / `login` /
`config set` rewrites the file in the new layout.

Use **dotted keys** like `hosted.admin_key` and `node.endpoint` with
`paycli config get/set` (run `paycli config keys` for the full list).

## Commands

### `paycli register [<wallet-name>] [--route hosted|node] [--username … --password …]`

**Hosted, anonymous (default)** — creates a fresh user + first wallet via
`POST /api/v1/account`. The DB row has empty username and no password
hash, so the account can't log into the LNbits dashboard. Best for AI
agents / automated provisioning where the admin_key is the only auth
the caller will ever use.

```bash
paycli --base-url http://127.0.0.1:5002 register "main"
```

**Hosted, named** — when `--username` is set, switches to
`POST /api/v1/auth/register`. The DB row gets a real `username` plus a
bcrypt password hash, so the resulting account can:

- log into the LNbits dashboard with username + password
- be re-authenticated via `paycli auth-login`
- act as super-user / operator if its account id matches `super_user`
  or is in `lnbits_admin_users`

`paycli` also fetches the auto-created wallet's keys (via
`GET /api/v1/wallets`, Bearer auth on the just-issued JWT) and caches
them alongside the JWT in the config — one command, fully ready for
subsequent `whoami` / `fund` / `topup` / `admin-set`.

```bash
# Username must match lnbits' is_valid_username regex:
#   ^[a-zA-Z0-9._]{2,20}$, no leading/trailing _ or ., no double __ or ..
# Dashes / hyphens are NOT allowed.
paycli --base-url http://127.0.0.1:5002 \
    register --username alice --password "alice-pw" --email alice@example.com \
    "alice-treasury"
```

If `--password` is omitted the CLI prompts on the tty.

> ⚠️ **Flag-ordering caveat** (urfave/cli v2): the v2 parser stops
> reading flags at the first positional argument. Put **all `--flag`
> options BEFORE** the `[wallet-name]` positional. paycli detects the
> wrong order and prints a helpful error rather than silently
> falling through to the anonymous path.

**Node** — no remote provisioning step; just pins the connection settings
and probes `GetInfo` for sanity. Wallet name is optional in this mode.

```bash
paycli register --route node \
    --lnd-endpoint  https://127.0.0.1:8081 \
    --lnd-tls-cert  /tmp/lnd-sui-test/alice/tls.cert \
    --lnd-macaroon  /tmp/lnd-sui-test/alice/data/chain/sui/devnet/admin.macaroon
```

### `paycli login --route hosted|node …`

Persist existing credentials without making a remote call. Useful when
you've provisioned the wallet/keys elsewhere.

```bash
# hosted
paycli login --admin-key 0123abcd... --invoice-key fedcba...

# node
paycli login --route node \
    --lnd-endpoint  https://127.0.0.1:8081 \
    --lnd-tls-cert  /path/to/tls.cert \
    --lnd-macaroon  /path/to/admin.macaroon
```

### `paycli whoami`

* hosted: `GET /api/v1/wallet` — returns wallet name + balance.
* node: `GET /v1/getinfo` — returns identity_pubkey, alias, channel counts.

(node-mode `GetInfo` against lnd-sui devnet sometimes errors with the
chain-backend's pprof page — see `docs/sdk.md#known-issue-with-lnd-sui-devnet`.)

### `paycli fund --amount N [--memo …] [--unit sat] [--expiry seconds]`

Generate a BOLT11 invoice for receiving funds into the configured wallet.

* hosted: `POST /api/v1/payments {out:false, amount:N}` → returns the full
  hosted `Payment` object including `bolt11`.
* node: `POST /v1/invoices {value:N, memo, expiry}` → returns the lnd
  `AddInvoice` response with `payment_request`.

```bash
paycli fund --amount 1000 --memo "topup"
```

### `paycli pay <bolt11>`

Settle a BOLT11 invoice from the configured wallet.

* hosted: `POST /api/v1/payments {out:true, bolt11}` — requires admin key.
* node: `POST /v1/channels/transactions {payment_request}` — synchronous
  send via the macaroon.

```bash
paycli pay lnbc100u1p3...
```

### `paycli history [--limit N] [--offset M]`

List recent payments on the configured wallet.

### `paycli config show [--reveal] [--path]`

Print the active config. Secrets (admin key, invoice key, bearer token)
are masked unless `--reveal` is passed. `--path` prints just the resolved
config file path.

### `paycli config get <key>` / `paycli config set <key> <value>`

Edit a single config field without hand-touching JSON. Keys are dotted
paths matching the on-disk JSON layout. Run `paycli config keys` for
the full list.

```bash
paycli config set hosted.base_url http://127.0.0.1:5002
paycli config set route node
paycli config get node.endpoint
```

### `paycli services --prism-url … --prism-macaroon … [-s X] [--insecure]`

List the L402 service catalog from a Prism gateway. The underlying
`GET /api/admin/services` is admin-gated by Prism today, so this command
takes the gateway operator's `admin.macaroon`. With `--search`,
case-insensitive substring filter on name/host/path.

```bash
paycli services \
    --prism-url       https://127.0.0.1:8080 \
    --prism-macaroon  /path/to/prism/.prism/admin.macaroon \
    --insecure
```

### `paycli auth-login --username … [--password …]` (operator)

Exchange super-user / admin credentials for a JWT and cache it in the
config. Required before `paycli topup`. Password may be supplied via
`--password` or read interactively from the tty.

### `paycli events [-n N] [-t TYPE] [-r ROUTE] [-s RFC3339] [--json] [--path]`

Show the local payment event log at `~/.paycli/events.jsonl`. Every
state-changing payment command — `register` (hosted), `fund`, `pay`,
`request` (per L402 settlement), `topup` — appends one structured row
to this file as it runs.

```bash
paycli events                                    # last 20, human-readable
paycli events -n 100 -t l402_paid                # last 100 L402 settlements
paycli events -r hosted -s 2026-05-07T00:00:00Z  # hosted-route events from today
paycli events --json | jq                        # raw JSONL for tooling
paycli events --path                             # just print the log path
```

Set `PAYCLI_EVENT_LOG=off` (or `0` / `false`) to disable logging
entirely, or set it to a file path to redirect.

The schema fields:

| Field | Notes |
|---|---|
| `ts` | RFC3339Nano UTC |
| `event` | `account_created` \| `invoice_created` \| `pay_sent` \| `l402_paid` \| `topup_credit` |
| `route` | `hosted` or `node` |
| `endpoint` | base_url (hosted) or lnd REST URL (node) |
| `wallet_id`, `user_id` | populated when known |
| `amount`, `unit` | positive = inflow, negative = outflow |
| `payment_hash`, `preimage`, `status` | settlement detail |
| `target_url`, `target_host` | L402-only: where the request went |
| `payment_request` | bolt11 (for invoice_created and l402_paid) |
| `error` | populated on failure |

### `paycli admin-set <key> <value>` (operator)

PATCH a single field on `agents-pay-service`'s admin settings via
`PATCH /admin/api/v1/settings`. The value is JSON-parsed when possible
(so `true` / `42` / `"str"` / `["a","b"]` round-trip), otherwise sent
as a plain string.

Most common use: enable LND self-payment so a wallet can pay invoices
issued by the same lnd it's funded from (e.g. paying a Prism paywall
that's authenticated by the same node):

```bash
paycli auth-login --username admin                       # one-time
paycli admin-set lnd_grpc_allow_self_payment true        # persists to DB
pkill -f 'lnbits --port 5002' && lnbits --port 5002 &    # restart so the
                                                         # wallet driver
                                                         # picks up the flag
```

Note: env vars like `LND_GRPC_ALLOW_SELF_PAYMENT=true` look like they
should work but are silently overridden at boot — lnbits' admin-DB
contents shadow editable env values. Use `admin-set` instead.

### `paycli topup --wallet-id … --amount N` (operator)

Credit a hosted wallet directly (faucet) via
`PUT /users/api/v1/balance`. Bypasses LN routing — internally
agents-pay-service synthesizes a successful incoming payment, the same
way the dashboard "credit user" button does. Use to onboard test
wallets without round-tripping through a channel.

Negative `--amount` debits the wallet.

### `paycli add-wallet <name> [--user-id …]`

Create an additional sub-wallet. Defaults to the user_id cached by `register`.
Note: the upstream LNbits server must have `user_id_only` enabled in
`LNBITS_AUTH_METHODS` for this to work.

### `paycli request <url> [--method GET] [-H 'Key: Value'] [-d body] [-i] [--insecure-target] [--max-retries 1]`

HTTP request with automatic L402 (HTTP 402) payment handling.

Behind the scenes:

1. Build the request from flags.
2. Send via `sdk.L402Doer` wired to the active route's wallet.
3. On 402, parse `WWW-Authenticate: LSAT macaroon="…", invoice="…"`.
4. Pay the invoice via the active route:
   * hosted → `POST /api/v1/payments {out:true,bolt11}` (admin key).
   * node → `POST /v1/channels/transactions {payment_request}` (macaroon).
5. Re-send with `Authorization: LSAT <mac>:<preimage>`.

Hosted mode requires an admin key (invoice keys can't spend). Node mode
just needs whatever macaroon is configured — usually `admin.macaroon`.

```bash
# Local Prism (self-signed cert, hostregexp routes by Host header):
paycli request \
    -H "Host: service1.com" \
    --insecure-target -i \
    https://127.0.0.1:8080/freebieservice
```

Notes:

* The `Host` header is special — `paycli` recognizes it and sets
  `req.Host` rather than `req.Header["Host"]` (which `net/http` ignores).
* Tokens are cached in-process for the lifetime of the command; running the
  command twice in one shell still pays twice. Long-lived processes that
  re-use the same `L402Doer` get free token reuse.
* `--insecure-target` disables TLS verification on the **target** URL only.
  `--insecure` (global) disables TLS verification on the **wallet** URL.

## Exit codes

* `0` — success
* `1` — any error (API error, network, build error, etc.). The error
  message is printed to stderr.

## Examples

End-to-end flow:

```bash
# 1. provision an agent wallet
paycli --base-url http://127.0.0.1:5002 register "agent-001"

# 2. top it up — print the invoice, have an external wallet pay it
paycli fund --amount 100000 --memo "agent budget"
# (pay the printed bolt11 from another wallet/lncli)

# 3. consume a paid API behind Prism
paycli request \
    -H "Host: service1.com" \
    --insecure-target -i \
    https://127.0.0.1:8080/api/some-endpoint
```
